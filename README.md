# Panel-Manager
MEAN Stack Project

## Project Idea
I've always wanted to create some sort of server manager application that allows me to manage, monitor and apply updates to various 
Linux VPS's and machines I'm currently managing. I know many other solutions exist on the market right now, but I wanted this manager to focus on game servers, and possibly HPC systems management. This project will be more of a experimental endeavour, which will allowing me to explore the different areas full-stack development in MEAN.

## Implementation
I plan on using the MEAN stack to create and implement my ideas into something that actually just works, thatâ€™s quick and painless to install in the backend. NodeJS allows the application to run on any platform, not just Linux or Windows. Furthermore, the JavaScript runtime also allows the application to run on multiple machines, to load-balance and distribute clients to multiple instances improving uptime.
